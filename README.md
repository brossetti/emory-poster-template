# Emory University Tikzposter Template

This poster template uses the tikzposter class and a custom style file for Emory University. Feel free to change things up as needed. The `main.tex` file provides examples of how to use the tikzposter class, and the `sample.pdf` file shows the results.

You can find this template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/emory-poster-template/skpfmpxjnqdh).
